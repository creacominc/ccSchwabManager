## Description
@Swift @SwiftUI @Swift Testing @Apple Design Tips @Xcode @GitHub Actions

I want to create an application that can run on both IOS and MacOS called ccSchwabMzanger.  This app will be used to view current holdings in multiple accounts at Schwab and suggest a buy and a sell order for each security as it is selected from a list.

You may use the existing classes as a guide or as they are.

The app should first load a Secrets object from the keychain using the readSecrets moethod in the KeychainManager.  This object, when stored in the keychain, is in JSON format and may contain the appId, appSecret, redirectUrl, code, session, accessToken, refreshToken, and a list of accountNumberHash objects.   Any of these values may be nil.  

If the secrets object is not found in the keychain or it does not have the appId or appSecret or redirectUrl, a dialog should prompt the user for the appId, appSecret, and redirectUrl.  Once those are entered, the secrets object should be stored in the keychain and the user should be presented with a button which will launch authentication through a link object which goes to the Schwab api login web page.  The authorization URL can be retrieved from  getAuthorizationUrl.   

There should be a text field in which the user can paste the results of the authentication.  When they do, the app should extract the ‘code’ from the pasted URL and save it in the secrets object as seen in handleAuthorization.

With the code saved in the secrets object and to the keychain, the app should fetch the account numbers as seen in fetchAccountNumbers then the account listings should be fetched as seen in fetchAccounts.  

The fetchAccounts method provides a list of symbols in the accounts which should be presented to the user in a table with the following fields taken from the Account, Position, and Instrument classes if they are available:  accountNumber, averagePrice, longQuantity, agedQuantity, marketValue, longOpenProfitLoss, assetType, symbol, description, closingPrice.

The table should be able to be filtered sorted on any of these columns.

There should be a way for the user to reset the secrets object partially (clearing all but the appId, appSecret, and callbackUrl) or fully.
