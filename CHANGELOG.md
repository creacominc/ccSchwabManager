  - Enhanced logging to show validation results with clear success/failure messages
  - Top-100 orders remain exempt from available shares validation as requested
  - Improved order reliability by preventing invalid share quantities

### Changed
- **ENHANCED**: Break-even calculation logic for profitable positions
  - When the highest cost-per-share tax lot is already profitable, the system now uses enhanced logic:
    - Target price is set to the average of cost-per-share and last price (instead of traditional break-even)
    - Shares to sell are set to 50% of the highest tax lot (providing better position management)
    - Entry price is set at 3/4 of the difference above cost-per-share (providing greater trailing stop room)
    - Cancel price is set at 1/4 above cost-per-share (25% above cost basis)
    - Trailing stop is calculated as 1/4 of the difference as percentage (dynamic based on profit potential)
  - Original break-even logic is maintained for non-profitable highest cost lots
  - This provides better risk management and larger trailing stops when the most expensive shares are already profitable
- **SIMPLIFIED**: OCO order descriptions to remove problematic timing information
  - Removed submit and cancel times from all order descriptions to eliminate timing-related issues
  - Sell orders no longer include "GTC SUBMIT AT {time}" in descriptions
  - Buy orders no longer include "Submit {date}" in descriptions
  - OCO orders are now cleaner and focus on core order parameters without timing constraints
  - This resolves issues with order submission timing and improves order clarity

### Fixed
- **FIXED**: Sales Calc table layout and sizing issues
  - Restored proper table sizing to maximize available space usage
  - Fixed height constraint to use 88% of available height while leaving space for "Copied:" message
  - Restored GeometryReader to ensure table properly fills available space
  - Table now displays at full size like other tables in the application
  - "Copied:" message remains visible at bottom when copy operations occur
- **FIXED**: iOS copy-to-clipboard functionality in SalesCalcTableView
  - Fixed state management issue where copyToClipboard functions weren't properly updating the copiedValue state
  - Moved copyToClipboard functions to TableContent struct with proper @Binding for state updates
  - Ensures copy-to-clipboard works consistently on both iOS and macOS platforms
  - Users can now click on any field in the sales calc table to copy values to clipboard
- **FIXED**: Min ATR sell order logic inconsistency
  - Updated Min ATR order to use correct trailing stop calculation: `atrValue` (not `atrValue / 5.0`)
  - Replaced incorrect `atrValue / 5.0` calculation that was causing trailing stop to be too small
  - Now correctly calculates trailing stop as the actual ATR value for proper risk management
  - Fixed share calculation to use `calculateMinimumSharesForGain` instead of `calculateMinimumSharesForRemainingProfit`
  - Now calculates minimum shares needed to achieve 5% gain at target price (not to maintain profit on remaining position)
  - Calculates target price using `entry / (1.0 + trailingStop / 100.0)` like additional orders
  - Uses correct entry price calculation: `currentPrice * (1.0 - atrValue / 100.0)` (1 ATR below current price)
  - Maintains same exit price calculation as other sell orders
  - Fixes bug where Min ATR had much lower trailing stop than intended (e.g., 0.85% instead of 4.27% for MOD)
  - Fixes bug where Min ATR was calculating 201 shares instead of ~7 shares needed for 5% gain
  - Ensures Min ATR orders use ATR as trailing stop and calculate minimum shares needed for 5% gain

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Enhanced `cancelOrders` function to use order-specific account resolution instead of first account
- **BREAKING**: Updated order cancellation to find each order's account number and corresponding hash value
- **BREAKING**: Updated all sell order calculations to use minimum shares logic:
  - Top 100 Order: Now calculates minimum shares needed for 3.25% gain (limited to 100 max)
  - Min ATR Order: Now calculates minimum shares needed to maintain 5% profit on remaining position
  - Min Break Even Order: Now calculates minimum shares needed for 1% gain at target price
- **BREAKING**: Modified `calculateMinimumSharesForGain` to prioritize profitable shares first, then include unprofitable shares only if necessary
- Updated sell order logic to use FIFO (First In, First Out) method starting with highest cost-per-share tax lots

### Technical Details

#### Order Cancellation Multi-Account Support
**Problem**: The `cancelOrders` function was using only the first account hash for all order cancellations, which could fail if orders belonged to different accounts.

**Solution**:
- Modified `cancelOrders` to find each order by its ID in `m_orderList`
- Extract the account number from each order's `accountNumber` property
- Look up the correct hash value for that specific account number
- Use the order-specific account hash for each cancellation request
- Added comprehensive logging to verify the correct account is being used

**Enhanced Logging**:
- Added detailed request verification with URL, order ID, account number, and hash value
- Added test mode support that simulates DELETE requests without making actual API calls
- Added success/failure summary with counts and error details
- Added emoji indicators for better visual scanning of logs

**Example Impact**:
- **Before**: All orders cancelled using first account hash (could fail for multi-account setups)
- **After**: Each order cancelled using its specific account hash (supports multiple accounts)

**Files Modified**:
- `SchwabClient.swift` - Enhanced `cancelOrders` function with account resolution and logging

#### Minimum Shares Optimization
**Problem**: Sell orders were using the full quantity of tax lots instead of calculating the minimum shares needed to meet the requirements, resulting in unnecessarily large sell orders.

**Solution**:
- Added `calculateMinimumSharesForGain` helper function that finds the minimum shares needed to achieve a specific gain percentage at a target price
- Added `calculateMinimumSharesForRemainingProfit` helper function that calculates minimum shares needed to maintain a specific profit percentage on the remaining position
- Implemented intelligent share selection that:
  1. First tries to achieve target gain using only profitable shares
  2. Starts with highest cost-per-share profitable shares (FIFO method)
  3. Stops as soon as target gain is achieved
  4. Only includes unprofitable shares if absolutely necessary

**Example Impact**:
- **Before**: Min Break Even order might sell 123 shares (all shares from multiple tax lots)
- **After**: Min Break Even order sells only 100 shares (minimum needed to achieve 1% gain)

**Files Modified**:
- `RecommendedOCOOrdersSection.swift` - Added helper functions and updated all sell order calculations

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed sell order break-even calculations to use specific tax lot cost-per-share instead of overall position average
- Fixed sell order gain calculations to avoid division by zero (NaN values)
- Updated test implementations to match corrected sell order logic
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed last price display to use real-time quote data instead of yesterday's close
- Updated order calculations and Sales Calc table to use current market price from quote

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Updated `calculateMinBreakEvenOrder` to use weighted average cost per share for specific shares being sold
- **BREAKING**: Updated `calculateMinSharesFor5PercentProfit` to track cost of shares from each tax lot individually
- Modified sell order calculations to start with highest cost-per-share tax lots (FIFO method)
- **BREAKING**: Updated `computeTaxLots` to accept optional current price parameter for real-time pricing
- Modified `getCurrentPrice()` method to prioritize real-time quote data over price history
- Updated component hierarchy to pass quote data through to order calculations

### Technical Details

#### Sell Order Break-even Fix
**Problem**: Sell orders were using the overall position average cost per share (41.34) instead of the specific cost-per-share for the tax lots being sold, leading to inaccurate break-even calculations.

**Solution**:
- Modified `calculateMinBreakEvenOrder` to track cumulative cost and shares for specific tax lots being sold
- Updated `calculateMinSharesFor5PercentProfit` to calculate actual cost per share for shares being sold
- Fixed gain calculation formula to use `((target - actualCostPerShare) / actualCostPerShare) * 100.0`
- Updated test implementations in `OrderLogicTests.swift` and `CSVValidationTests.swift` to match corrected logic

#### Tax Lot Cost Calculation
**Problem**: Sell orders were not properly calculating the weighted average cost for the specific shares being sold.

**Solution**:
- Implemented proper tracking of cumulative cost and shares for each tax lot
- Used FIFO (First In, First Out) method starting with highest cost-per-share tax lots
- Calculated actual cost per share as `cumulativeCost / cumulativeShares` for specific shares being sold

### Added
- CSV export functionality for transaction history and tax lot data
- Diagnostic logging for shares available for trading calculation
- New method `computeSharesAvailableForTrading(symbol:taxLots:)` that accepts precomputed tax lots
- State variable `computedSharesAvailableForTrading` in PositionDetailView for real-time calculation
- Support for merged/renamed securities with automatic cost-per-share computation
- New method `handleMergedRenamedSecurities` to detect and fix zero-cost transactions
- New method `getComputedPriceForTransaction` to display correct prices in transaction history
- New method `getAveragePrice` to retrieve average price from position data

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Updated `calculateMinBreakEvenOrder` calculation method to match sample.log format
- **BREAKING**: Changed AATR calculation from fixed 0.75% to ATR/5 (one-fifth of ATR)
- **BREAKING**: Updated entry price calculation from `last / (1 + (1.5*AATR/100))` to `Last - 1 AATR%`
- **BREAKING**: Updated target price calculation from `avg_cost * 1.0325` to `Entry - 2 AATR%`
- **BREAKING**: Updated exit price calculation from `target * 0.991` to `Target - 2 AATR%`
- **BREAKING**: Optimized minimum shares calculation to sell only the minimum shares needed to achieve 1% gain target
- Updated README.md to reflect new calculation method and examples
- Removed outdated test files that used old calculation method

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Removed private method `calculateSharesAvailableForTrading` from SchwabClient to prevent circular dependencies
- Updated `getTransactionsFor` method to remove shares calculation to avoid deadlock
- Modified PositionDetailView to compute shares available for trading when the view loads
- Fixed date parsing in shares available calculation to handle tax lot date format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
- Updated HoldingsView to call `computeTaxLots` first, then `computeSharesAvailableForTrading`

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Resolved deadlock caused by circular dependency between `getTransactionsFor`, `computeTaxLots`, and shares calculation
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed shares available for trading showing 0.00 in PositionDetailView
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed all tax lot dates being skipped as "invalid date" due to incorrect date parsing
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed merged/renamed securities showing 0.00 cost-per-share in tax lots and transaction history
- Fixed infinite loops caused by recursive method calls
- Fixed build warnings by removing unused variables

### Technical Details

#### Deadlock Resolution
The deadlock was caused by the following circular dependency:
1. `getTransactionsFor` called `calculateSharesAvailableForTrading`
2. `calculateSharesAvailableForTrading` called `computeTaxLots`
3. `computeTaxLots` called `getTransactionsFor` again

**Solution**: 
- Removed shares calculation from `getTransactionsFor`
- Created new method `computeSharesAvailableForTrading(symbol:taxLots:)`
